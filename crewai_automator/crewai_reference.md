# CrewAI Reference Meta-Prompt

## Purpose
This document serves as the **meta-prompt** for generating CrewAI Python scripts using an LLM.
The user should replace this content with their detailed meta-prompt, including instructions for the LLM,
examples, and best practices for structuring the output Python script.

## Key areas to detail:
- Mandatory script structure (imports, agent/task/crew definitions, kickoff).
- API key handling (use os.getenv).
- Tool usage and imports.
- Expected LLM behavior for processing user instructions.
- Output format (raw Python code).

**Please replace this placeholder with your full `crewai_reference.md` content.**
